# About Me

I am an MPH student at Columbia Universityâ€™s Mailman School of Public Health, specializing in Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics & Public Health Data Science. My training combines data-driven analysis with a deep commitment to improving health outcomes. Experience in nonprofit, clinical research, and industry settings has given me a versatile problem-solving toolkit and a clear guiding principle: rigorous research should ultimately serve people.
